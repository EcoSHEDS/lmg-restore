From the Basin Characteristics dataset, it includes basin area, baseflow index, hydro-geological classifications, annual average precipitation and air temperature, and land use composition. From the Streamflow Statistics dataset, it includes various metrics such as the mean, median, and lower/upper quartile streamflow at each gage. Lastly, it includes the main seasonal results from the Streamflow Trend Analyses dataset. Together, these metrics can be used to better understand relationships between the basin characteristics, streamflow statitistics and streamflow trends at USGS gages throughout the region.",

The first method is streamflow trend analysis using the Quantile-Kendall methodology developed by Robert M. Hirsch. The second method is calculating hydro change which is a modified method of calculating ecosurplus and ecodeficit. For this project ecosurplus and ecodeficit have been combined to assess overall hydrologic regime change. The third method is the confidence interval hypothesis test developed by Charles N. Kroll. The first two methods are a means of quantifying hydrologic alteration while the third is a hypothesis test to simply determine if statistically significant alteration has occurred. All three methods are employed to determine which is the best at determining alteration of the hydrologic regime in the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (RESTORE) study area. Statistical analysis was done in RStudio. The HUC12 pour points are the geographic data used to view the results spatially.",
