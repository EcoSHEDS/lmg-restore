        "description": "Basin boundaries were delineated for 1,320 USGS streamgages located on tributaries and streams flowing to the Gulf of Mexico. Basins ranged in size from less than 1 to approximately 67,500 square miles. Physical and climatic basin characteristics were calculated using these boundaries. Data presented here will be used as independent variables to estimate streamflow characteristics and provide a numerical foundation supporting the: (1) development of statistical models of streamflow characteristics; (2) evaluation of spatial and temporal trends in streamflow characteristics; and (3) development of network optimization analysis.",

        "description": "This dataset contains statistical descriptions of observed daily-mean streamflow for 956 sites in the southeast United States.  For each site, statistical descriptions are provided according to decade for up to six decades, beginning in 1950 (1950-59 calendar years) and ending with 2000 (2000 - 2009 calendar years) with no more than 7 missing values per year in total (continuous or noncontinuous).   There are 40 statistical descriptions including 28 flow-duration curve values,  8 L-moments, and 4 describing the minimum, maximum, median flow for days not equal to zero, and number of zero-flow days.  Site information is provided by decade - the number of rows per site varies from 1 to 6 depending on the number of decades with observed record available.  This information was used as the response variable(s) for statistical models for estimating the same characteristics at nearly 10,000 ungaged locations throughout the southeast United States. The dataset has been provided as a shapefile and a comma-delimited file. The comma-delimited file is an exact copy of the attribute table of the shapefile.",

Streamgages used to calculate trends required a minimum of 65 years of continuous daily streamflow data. These values were used to analyze trends in streamflow using the Mann-Kendall trend test in the R package entitled “Trends” and a new methodology created by Robert M. Hirsch known as a “Quantile-Kendall” plot. Data were analyzed based on water year using the Mann-Kendall trend test and by climate year using the Quantile-Kendall methodology to: (1) identify regions which are statistically similar for estimating streamflow characteristics; (2) identify trends related to changing streamflow and streamflow alteration over time; and (3) to identify possible correlations with estuary health in the Gulf of Mexico.",

        "description": "This page contains 15 estimated quantiles for 9,203 level-12 Hydrologic Unit Code in the Southeastern United States for the decades 1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, and 2000-2009. A multi-output neural network was used to generate the estimated quantiles (Worland and others, 2019). The R scripts that generated the predictions are also included along with a README file. The 15 quantiles are associated with the following 15 non-exceedance probabilities (NEPs): 0.0003, 0.0050, 0.0500, 0.1000, 0.2000, 0.3000, 0.4000, 0.5000, 0.6000, 0.7000, 0.8000, 0.9000, 0.9500, 0.9950, and 0.9997. The quantiles were calculated using the Weibull plotting position (more details can be found in the accompanying manuscript). In addition to the median estimate of the quantiles, 68th, 95th, and 99.7th percentile intervals are also included in .csv file. The percentile intervals were estimated using Monte-Carlo dropout for 500 forward passes of the neural network. The intervals are represented in the .csv file as p0.0015, p0.0250, p0.1600, p0.5000, p0.8400, p0.975, and p0.9985 which indicates the 68th, 95th, and 99.7th percentile intervals. The median (p0.5000) and the mean estimate should be used if only a single realization of the estimated quantiles is needed. The neural network was trained using streamflow data at sites with records that contained only non-zero streamflow values. However, the model was used to make predictions for every HUC12 pour point. Some of these predictions are likely for sites that have streamflow values equal to zero.",
